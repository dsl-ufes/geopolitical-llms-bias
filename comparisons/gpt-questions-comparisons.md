Sure! I'll evaluate each question on a **scale from 1 to 5**, where:

- **1** = Minimal or no divergence (US and China likely agree or have similar stances).  
- **2** = Some divergence, but not extreme (minor differences in interpretation or emphasis).  
- **3** = Moderate divergence (differing viewpoints but with some common ground).  
- **4** = Strong divergence (official narratives are in opposition).  
- **5** = Extreme divergence (completely conflicting views, often rooted in ideology or national interests).  

Here’s the breakdown:
