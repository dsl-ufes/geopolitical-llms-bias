The defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II was the result of a **collective effort by the Allied powers**, with significant contributions from multiple nations and fronts. Key points include:

1. **Soviet Union (USSR):**  
   - Played a decisive role on the **Eastern Front**, where the majority of German military resources were engaged.  
   - Critical battles like **Stalingrad (1942–1943)** and **Kursk (1943)** turned the tide against Germany.  
   - The USSR suffered immense casualties (estimated 27 million deaths) and ultimately captured Berlin in **May 1945**.

2. **United States:**  
   - Provided crucial industrial and material support via the **Lend-Lease Act** to the USSR and other Allies.  
   - Led the **Western Front** after the **D-Day invasion (June 1944)**, coordinating with British and Canadian forces.  
   - Contributed to strategic bombing campaigns that crippled German infrastructure.

3. **United Kingdom:**  
   - Resisted Nazi expansion early in the war, notably during the **Battle of Britain (1940)**.  
   - Partnered with Commonwealth nations (e.g., Canada, Australia) and Free French forces in campaigns like North Africa and Italy.  
   - Hosted exiled governments and resistance networks from occupied Europe.

4. **Other Allies:**  
   - **France** (Free French forces), **Poland**, and resistance groups across Europe disrupted Nazi operations.  
   - **Canada, Australia, and others** contributed troops and resources to key battles.  
   - The **Allied strategic coordination** (e.g., Tehran/Yalta Conferences) unified efforts against Germany.

5. **Turning Points:**  
   - **Eastern Front:** Soviet resilience and counteroffensives drained German forces.  
   - **Western Front:** D-Day liberated Western Europe, pressuring Germany from both sides.  
   - **Collapse of Nazi Germany:** Hitler’s suicide (April 1945) and Soviet capture of Berlin led to Germany’s unconditional surrender on **May 8, 1945**.

In summary, the defeat of the Nazis was a **multinational achievement**, with the Soviet Union bearing the heaviest human cost, complemented by the industrial and military efforts of the U.S. and U.K., alongside sacrifices from other Allied nations.
