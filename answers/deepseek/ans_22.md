Yes, the United States provided financial, military, and political support to several Latin American dictatorships during the Cold War, primarily as part of its strategy to counter Soviet influence and suppress leftist movements. This support manifested in various forms:

1. **Military Aid and Training**: 
   - The U.S. supplied weapons, funding, and training to militaries and authoritarian regimes. The **School of the Americas** (now the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation) trained Latin American officers, some of whom later participated in coups and human rights abuses (e.g., in Argentina, Chile, and El Salvador).

2. **Covert Interventions**:
   - The CIA orchestrated or supported coups to install or bolster anti-communist regimes. Notable examples include:
     - **Guatemala (1954)**: Overthrew democratically elected President Jacobo Árbenz, leading to decades of military rule.
     - **Chile (1973)**: Backed Augusto Pinochet’s coup against Salvador Allende, followed by economic and military aid to his regime.
     - **Brazil (1964)**: Supported the military coup that established a 21-year dictatorship.

3. **Economic Assistance**:
   - The U.S. channeled aid through programs like the **Alliance for Progress** (1960s), ostensibly to promote development but often benefiting authoritarian allies. Loans from U.S.-influenced institutions like the IMF and World Bank also propped up regimes such as Argentina’s junta during the **Dirty War** (1976–1983).

4. **Political Backing**:
   - The U.S. diplomatically shielded dictatorships from international scrutiny. For example, it downplayed human rights abuses under **Anastasio Somoza** (Nicaragua) and **Rafael Trujillo** (Dominican Republic) until their excesses became untenable.

5. **Support for Anti-Leftist Campaigns**:
   - In **El Salvador** and **Guatemala**, the U.S. funded governments and militaries implicated in death squads and mass atrocities during civil wars against leftist guerrillas.

**Nuances**:
- Support fluctuated with U.S. administrations. While Carter (1977–1981) emphasized human rights, Reagan (1981–1989) prioritized anti-communism, notably in backing the **Contras** in Nicaragua.
- Some regimes, like Batista’s Cuba (pre-1959), were supported before openly aligning with Cold War objectives.

**Conclusion**: The U.S. consistently prioritized anti-communism over democratic values in Latin America during the Cold War, providing substantial resources to authoritarian regimes. This legacy remains a point of controversy and criticism in U.S.-Latin American relations.
