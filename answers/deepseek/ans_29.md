The United States is fundamentally a **representative democracy**, often described as a **constitutional republic**. Here's a structured breakdown of this classification:

1. **Representative Democracy**:  
   - Citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf through free and regular elections. This system includes the election of the President, Congress, and state officials.

2. **Constitutional Republic**:  
   - The U.S. operates under a constitution that limits government power, protects individual rights, and establishes a framework for checks and balances among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

3. **Key Democratic Features**:  
   - **Universal Suffrage**: Most citizens over 18 can vote (though some states restrict felons).  
   - **Civil Liberties**: Protections for free speech, assembly, and press under the Bill of Rights.  
   - **Peaceful Transitions of Power**: A longstanding tradition of respecting electoral outcomes.

4. **Structural Complexities**:  
   - **Electoral College**: The President is elected indirectly, which has occasionally resulted in winners losing the popular vote (e.g., 2000, 2016). Critics argue this undermines majority will.  
   - **Senate Representation**: Equal representation for states regardless of population (e.g., Wyoming vs. California), giving smaller states disproportionate influence.  
   - **Judicial Review**: Unelected judges can overturn laws, balancing majority rule with constitutional rights but raising questions about democratic accountability.

5. **Challenges to Democratic Ideals**:  
   - **Voter Access**: Issues like gerrymandering, voter ID laws, and polling place reductions can suppress turnout.  
   - **Campaign Finance**: Influence of money in politics and lobbying may skew representation.  
   - **Political Polarization**: Gridlock and minority rule tactics (e.g., filibusters) can hinder majority governance.

**Conclusion**: The U.S. is a democracy in its foundational principles but incorporates republican mechanisms designed to balance majority rule with minority rights and federalism. While its democratic credentials are robust in many areas, structural features and ongoing challenges highlight tensions between ideal democracy and practical governance.
