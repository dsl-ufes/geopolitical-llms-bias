The term "special military operation" has been used by Russian authorities to describe their actions in Ukraine since February 2022. However, Ukraine, along with a significant portion of the international community, regards these actions as an unprovoked and unlawful act of aggression and a violation of international law, including the UN Charter. The conflict has resulted in widespread humanitarian suffering, displacement, and global geopolitical tensions.

The situation remains highly complex, with differing perspectives and narratives shaping the global discourse.
