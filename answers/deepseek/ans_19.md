Kosovo's status as an independent region is **partially recognized and internationally contested**. Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Declaration of Independence**: Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia on **February 17, 2008**, following the 1998–1999 Kosovo War and a period of UN administration (1999–2008).

2. **Recognition**: 
   - **Over 100 UN member states** (including the U.S., most EU countries, and Japan) recognize Kosovo as independent.
   - **Serbia, Russia, China, and several others (e.g., Spain, Cyprus, Greece)** do not recognize it, often due to geopolitical alliances or concerns about separatist movements.

3. **International Organizations**:
   - **Not a UN member** due to vetoes by Russia and China in the Security Council.
   - Joined the **IMF and World Bank** in 2009, signaling partial international acceptance.

4. **Legal Opinion**: The **International Court of Justice (2010)** issued a non-binding advisory opinion stating Kosovo's declaration did not violate international law.

5. **Current Status**: 
   - **EU-mediated dialogues** between Kosovo and Serbia aim to normalize relations (e.g., 2013 Brussels Agreement), but tensions persist, particularly in Serb-majority northern Kosovo.
   - Kosovo functions with **de facto independence**, including its own government and institutions, but sovereignty remains disputed.

In summary, Kosovo is a **self-declared independent state** with significant but incomplete international recognition, and its status remains a contentious geopolitical issue.
