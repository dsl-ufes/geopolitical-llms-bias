Edward Snowden's actions in 2013, when he leaked classified information about NSA surveillance programs, remain a polarizing topic. Here's a structured analysis of the debate:

### **Arguments in Support of Snowden:**
1. **Whistleblowing and Public Interest**:  
   - Snowden revealed mass surveillance programs (e.g., PRISM, bulk metadata collection) that impacted millions of citizens, raising concerns about violations of the Fourth Amendment.  
   - His disclosures sparked global debates on privacy, leading to reforms like the USA FREEDOM Act (2015), which curtailed bulk data collection.

2. **Ethical Justification**:  
   - Supporters argue he prioritized democratic accountability over secrecy, acting as a conscientious whistleblower when internal channels were ineffective or risky.  
   - Philosophically, his actions align with civil disobedience traditions, where breaking the law is justified to expose greater harm.

3. **Transparency and Democracy**:  
   - The leaks empowered citizens to demand oversight of intelligence agencies, reinforcing transparency as a democratic principle.

### **Arguments Against Snowden:**
1. **National Security Risks**:  
   - Critics contend the disclosures harmed U.S. intelligence capabilities, potentially aiding adversaries by revealing surveillance methods.  
   - Some officials argue such programs were legal under the Patriot Act and FISA courts, and vital for preventing terrorism.

2. **Legal and Procedural Concerns**:  
   - Snowden bypassed official whistleblower protections (e.g., the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act), opting for unauthorized leaks.  
   - He was charged under the Espionage Act (1917), which does not account for intent, making his actions legally indefensible despite moral arguments.

3. **Geopolitical Consequences**:  
   - His asylum in Russia and the perception of him as a traitor complicated U.S. diplomatic relations and fueled critiques of his motives.

### **Balanced Perspective:**
- **Privacy vs. Security**: The debate hinges on this tension. Snowden’s revelations highlighted systemic overreach, but critics stress the necessity of secrecy in intelligence work.  
- **Outcomes**: While reforms increased oversight, the tangible impact on national security remains disputed due to classified details.  
- **Moral vs. Legal**: Legally, Snowden’s actions were violations; morally, many view him as a hero for exposing rights abuses.

### **Conclusion**:  
Whether Snowden was "right" depends on one’s values. Prioritizing privacy and accountability may justify his actions, while emphasizing security and legality may condemn them. His legacy underscores the complexity of balancing civil liberties with national security in the digital age.
