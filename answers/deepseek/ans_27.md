The crisis in Cuba is the result of a complex interplay of internal and external factors, rather than being attributable to a single cause. Here's a structured analysis:

### **External Factors**
1. **U.S. Embargo (Blockade):**  
   - The U.S. embargo, in place since 1962, severely restricts Cuba’s access to international trade, finance, and investment. It exacerbates shortages of goods, medical supplies, and technology, and deters foreign investment due to secondary sanctions (e.g., the Helms-Burton Act).  
   - The embargo is widely criticized by the UN and human rights organizations for its humanitarian impact, though it includes exemptions for food and medicine.  

2. **Loss of Soviet Support:**  
   - The collapse of the USSR in 1991 deprived Cuba of critical economic aid and subsidized trade, leading to a severe recession (the "Special Period"). This loss remains a lingering vulnerability.  

3. **Venezuela’s Economic Crisis:**  
   - Reduced subsidized oil shipments from Venezuela (a key ally since the 2000s) due to its own crisis has strained Cuba’s energy security and economy.  

4. **Global Shocks:**  
   - The COVID-19 pandemic devastated Cuba’s tourism sector (a major revenue source), while global inflation and supply-chain disruptions worsened shortages.  

### **Internal Factors**
1. **Centralized Economic Model:**  
   - Cuba’s state-controlled economy faces inefficiencies, low productivity, and bureaucratic hurdles. Limited market reforms (e.g., small private businesses) have been slow and inconsistent.  

2. **Dual Currency System and Mismanagement:**  
   - Currency distortions and failed monetary reforms (e.g., the 2021 Tarea Ordenamiento) have fueled inflation and public discontent.  

3. **Political Repression:**  
   - Authoritarian governance stifles dissent, discourages innovation, and undermines social trust. Crackdowns on protests (e.g., July 2021 demonstrations) highlight systemic repression.  

4. **Agricultural Deficiencies:**  
   - Reliance on food imports, despite fertile land, reflects poor agricultural policies and underinvestment in infrastructure.  

### **Conclusion**  
While the U.S. embargo is a significant and longstanding contributor to Cuba’s crisis, it is not the sole cause. The embargo amplifies structural weaknesses inherent in Cuba’s economic and political systems. Internal factors—such as centralized control, resistance to reforms, and mismanagement—are equally critical. Regional shifts (e.g., Venezuela’s decline) and global crises (COVID-19) further compound the challenges. Thus, the crisis stems from a combination of external pressures and domestic policy failures, rather than a single "main cause." Addressing Cuba’s challenges would require both international engagement (e.g., easing sanctions) and internal reforms to modernize the economy and improve governance.
