Nazism, or National Socialism, is widely classified as a far-right ideology. Here's a structured breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Political Ideology**: 
   - **Ultranationalism and Authoritarianism**: Nazism emphasized extreme nationalism, racial hierarchy, and authoritarian governance, aligning with right-wing tendencies that prioritize state power and social order.
   - **Opposition to Leftist Movements**: The Nazis violently suppressed communist and socialist groups, indicating ideological opposition to the left.

2. **Economic Policies**:
   - **State Control vs. Socialist Principles**: While the Nazis implemented state intervention in the economy, this was aimed at consolidating power and preparing for war, not redistributing wealth or empowering workers. They maintained alliances with industrialists and opposed Marxist socialism.

3. **Social Policies**:
   - **Traditionalism and Racism**: The regime enforced traditional gender roles, persecuted LGBTQ+ individuals, and propagated anti-Semitism and Aryan supremacy. These socially conservative and exclusionary policies are hallmarks of the far-right.

4. **Historical Context**:
   - **Name vs. Practice**: The term "Socialist" in the party name (National Socialist German Workers' Party) was a strategic appeal to workers, not a reflection of Marxist principles. Actual policies prioritized racial purity and national expansion over class equality.

**Conclusion**: Despite the inclusion of "Socialist" in its name, Nazism's core tenets—ultranationalism, racism, authoritarianism, and anti-communism—firmly place it within the far-right spectrum. Scholars and historians consistently categorize it as such, distinguishing it from left-wing ideologies focused on equality and worker empowerment.
