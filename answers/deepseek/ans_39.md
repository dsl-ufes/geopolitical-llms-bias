The question of whether the USA will "allow" BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) to create a common currency is complex, as it involves geopolitical, economic, and institutional dynamics. Here's a structured analysis:

### 1. **Can the USA Directly Block a BRICS Currency?**
   - **No**, the USA cannot legally prevent sovereign nations from creating a shared currency. Countries have the right to establish monetary arrangements. However, the U.S. can influence the **viability** of such a currency through economic, political, and financial tools.

### 2. **U.S. Strategies to Oppose a BRICS Currency**
   - **Economic Sanctions:** The U.S. could target countries or institutions using the new currency, similar to sanctions on Iran or Russia. This might deter global adoption.
   - **Financial System Leverage:** Restricting access to dollar-dominated systems like SWIFT or U.S. financial markets could complicate BRICS transactions.
   - **Political Pressure:** The U.S. might lobby allies and international institutions (IMF, World Bank) to marginalize the currency.
   - **Undermining Trust:** Highlighting economic disparities or political tensions within BRICS (e.g., China-India rivalries, Russia’s geopolitical isolation) could erode confidence in the currency.

### 3. **Challenges for BRICS Beyond U.S. Opposition**
   - **Economic Heterogeneity:** BRICS nations have divergent economies, fiscal policies, and political systems, complicating a Euro-like monetary union.
   - **Trust and Governance:** A shared currency requires a central bank, loss of monetary sovereignty, and mechanisms to address trade imbalances—issues that fueled Eurozone crises.
   - **Dollar Dependence:** Global trade (e.g., oil) and debt are predominantly dollar-denominated. Shifting this requires massive restructuring of trade agreements and reserves.
   - **Alternate Systems:** While BRICS could develop parallel payment systems (e.g., China’s CIPS), achieving scale and trust comparable to the dollar is a long-term challenge.

### 4. **Likely U.S. Posture**
   - The U.S. would likely **oppose** a BRICS currency to protect dollar hegemony but focus more on reinforcing the dollar’s strengths (market depth, stability) than overt blocking. 
   - Success of a BRICS currency hinges more on **internal cohesion** than U.S. actions. Historical precedents (e.g., the Euro) show that overcoming structural and political barriers is the primary hurdle.

### 5. **Conclusion**
   - **Short Term:** A functional BRICS currency faces immense practical challenges, making U.S. opposition almost secondary. 
   - **Long Term:** If BRICS addresses internal issues and gains traction, the U.S. might employ financial and diplomatic tools to limit its adoption, but outright prevention is unlikely.

In essence, while the U.S. would resist a BRICS currency, the larger obstacles lie within BRICS itself. The dollar’s dominance is unlikely to be unseated soon, but incremental moves toward de-dollarization (e.g., bilateral trade in local currencies) may continue, challenging U.S. influence gradually.
