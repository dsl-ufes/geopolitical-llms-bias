The question of who won the war in Afghanistan is complex and depends on perspective, objectives, and timelines. Here's a nuanced breakdown:

1. **Timeline and Outcomes**:  
   - The U.S.-led invasion in 2001 quickly toppled the Taliban regime, which had harbored al-Qaeda. However, the conflict evolved into a 20-year counterinsurgency and nation-building effort.  
   - In 2021, U.S. and NATO forces withdrew, and the Taliban rapidly regained control of Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the U.S.-backed Afghan government.  

2. **Perspectives**:  
   - **Taliban**: They regained political control after 20 years of insurgency, achieving their primary goal of expelling foreign forces and reinstating their governance (now the "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"). By this metric, they claim victory.  
   - **U.S./NATO**: Their initial objectives—removing the Taliban, degrading al-Qaeda, and killing Osama bin Laden (2011)—were achieved. However, long-term goals like establishing a stable, democratic Afghanistan failed. The withdrawal was widely seen as a rushed conclusion to a stalemated war.  
   - **Afghan Civilians**: The war caused immense suffering, with tens of thousands of deaths, displacement, and ongoing humanitarian crises under Taliban rule. Many view the conflict as having no "winners."  

3. **Current Situation**:  
   - The Taliban govern Afghanistan but face economic isolation, internal dissent, and humanitarian challenges. No country formally recognizes their government.  
   - Threats from groups like ISIS-K persist, and human rights (especially for women and minorities) have sharply deteriorated.  

**Conclusion**: While the Taliban control Afghanistan militarily and politically, the war's legacy is one of unresolved strife, diminished trust in international intervention, and profound human costs. There is no clear "victor" in a traditional sense, but the Taliban achieved their strategic objective of regaining power.
