The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in late 2019, was caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The first known cases were reported in Wuhan, China, but referring to it as a "Chinese virus" is inaccurate and stigmatizing. Viruses do not respect national borders or ethnicities, and their emergence is a global public health issue, not a matter of geopolitical blame.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and scientific community explicitly discourage naming diseases after geographic locations to avoid fostering discrimination. While the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2 are still under investigation, most evidence suggests it likely originated in bats, possibly involving an intermediate animal host before spilling over to humans. The term "COVID-19" is the internationally accepted name for the disease caused by the virus.

Misleading labels like "Chinese virus" have been linked to increased racism and xenophobia, particularly against people of Asian descent. It is critical to focus on factual, evidence-based terminology to promote solidarity and effective global responses to health crises.
