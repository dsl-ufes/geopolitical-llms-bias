The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, is a highly complex conflict with multiple contributing factors and actors. Assigning sole responsibility is challenging, but key parties include:

1. **Syrian Government (Bashar al-Assad):**  
   The Assad regime's violent suppression of peaceful protests in 2011 escalated tensions into armed conflict. Its authoritarian governance, sectarian favoritism (favoring Alawites), and brutal tactics (e.g., barrel bombs, chemical weapons) prolonged the war and caused widespread civilian suffering.

2. **Foreign Interventions:**  
   - **Russia and Iran:** Provided critical military, financial, and political support to the Assad regime, enabling its survival. Russia's direct military intervention (2015) shifted the war's momentum.  
   - **United States, Turkey, Gulf States (Saudi Arabia, Qatar):** Supported opposition groups, often with competing agendas, fueling proxy dynamics. The U.S. also focused on combating ISIS, sometimes aligning with Kurdish forces (YPG), which strained relations with Turkey.  
   - **Turkey:** Opposed Assad and Kurdish groups, further complicating the conflict.  
   - **Hezbollah:** Iran-backed Shia militia fighting alongside Assad.

3. **Extremist Groups (e.g., ISIS, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham):**  
   Exploited the power vacuum, committing atrocities and drawing international military interventions.

4. **Structural Factors:**  
   - Long-standing sectarian divides and socioeconomic inequality under Assad's rule.  
   - The Arab Spring's regional wave of protests, which inspired initial demonstrations.  
   - Geopolitical rivalries (e.g., Saudi-Iran tensions, U.S.-Russia competition) turning Syria into a proxy battleground.

**Conclusion:**  
Primary responsibility lies with the Assad regime for its role in triggering and perpetuating the conflict. However, foreign powers (Russia, Iran, U.S., Turkey, Gulf States) exacerbated the war through military interventions and proxy support. Extremist groups and historical grievances also played significant roles. The war is thus a result of intertwined domestic repression, external interference, and sectarian-strategic rivalries.
