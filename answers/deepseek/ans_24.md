The Armenian Genocide, which occurred during World War I (1915â€“1923), was perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire under the leadership of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), commonly known as the Young Turks. The central figures responsible were the "Three Pashas": Mehmed Talaat (Minister of the Interior), Ismail Enver (War Minister), and Ahmed Djemal (Navy Minister). They orchestrated systematic deportations, mass killings, and forced marches targeting the Armenian population, driven by nationalist ideologies aiming to homogenize the empire and eliminate perceived threats from Christian minorities. 

**Key Context and Motivations:**
- **WWI Context:** The Ottomans, allied with Germany, feared Armenian collaboration with invading Russian forces, using this as a pretext for repression.
- **Ethnic Nationalism:** The CUP sought to create a Turkified state, targeting not only Armenians but also other Christian groups like Greeks and Assyrians.
- **Methods:** Deaths resulted from executions, starvation, and exhaustion during forced marches into Syrian deserts, with local officials and paramilitary groups often carrying out orders.

**Recognition and Denial:**
- While Turkey officially disputes the term "genocide," attributing deaths to wartime conditions, the international scholarly consensus (including the International Association of Genocide Scholars) recognizes it as genocide. Over 30 countries and international bodies formally acknowledge it as such.

In summary, the Armenian Genocide was a centrally planned campaign by the Ottoman government under CUP leadership, with the Three Pashas bearing direct responsibility. The events remain a highly politicized issue, but historical evidence underscores state-directed extermination.
