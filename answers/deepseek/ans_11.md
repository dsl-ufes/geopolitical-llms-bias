The **space race**, a pivotal Cold War competition between the United States and the Soviet Union (USSR) from the 1950s to the 1970s, is generally considered to have been **won by the United States**, though both nations achieved groundbreaking milestones.

### Key Achievements:
- **Soviet Union (Early Lead):**
  - **1957**: First artificial satellite (*Sputnik 1*).
  - **1961**: First human in space (*Yuri Gagarin*).
  - **1963**: First woman in space (*Valentina Tereshkova*).
  - **1965**: First spacewalk (*Alexei Leonov*).

- **United States (Climactic Victory):**
  - **1969**: First humans on the Moon (*Apollo 11*: Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin).
  - The Apollo program fulfilled President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 goal of landing a person on the Moon "before this decade is out," marking the race’s most iconic achievement.

### Why the U.S. is Often Declared the "Winner":
- The **Moon landing** became the defining objective of the space race, symbolizing technological and ideological supremacy during the Cold War. It was a globally televised triumph for the U.S., showcasing their sustained investment and innovation.

### Legacy:
- Both nations contributed immensely to space exploration, advancing rocketry, satellites, and human spaceflight.
- Post-Apollo cooperation (e.g., the 1975 *Apollo-Soyuz* mission) eventually replaced rivalry, paving the way for projects like the International Space Station.

In summary, while the USSR led early milestones, the U.S. achieved the most ambitious goal (the Moon landing), making it the symbolic winner. The space race’s true legacy lies in its acceleration of space technology and inspiration for global exploration.
