The Vietnam War concluded in 1975 with the **victory of North Vietnam** and the unification of the country under a communist government. Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Military Outcome**: North Vietnamese forces captured Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) on April 30, 1975, leading to the collapse of the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government. Vietnam was officially reunified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976.

2. **U.S. Withdrawal**: The U.S. withdrew combat troops in 1973 after the Paris Peace Accords but continued supporting South Vietnam. The eventual fall of Saigon marked a strategic defeat for the U.S., which failed to prevent communist unification.

3. **Human and Political Costs**: The war caused immense loss of life (millions of Vietnamese civilians and soldiers, over 58,000 U.S. troops) and left Vietnam devastated. Domestically, the war deeply divided American society and eroded trust in government.

4. **Postwar Context**: Vietnam faced economic hardship and isolation post-war but later normalized relations with the U.S. in the 1990s. The conflict remains a symbol of Cold War-era proxy struggles.

**Conclusion**: North Vietnam achieved its goal of reunification under communism, making it the clear victor. The U.S. and South Vietnam did not attain their objectives, marking the war as a significant Cold War defeat for American foreign policy. The outcome underscores the complexity of interpreting "victory" amid such profound human and political consequences.
