The question of who won the Cold War is often answered with the perspective that the **United States and its Western allies** emerged victorious, primarily because the **Soviet Union dissolved in 1991**, marking the end of the ideological and geopolitical rivalry. Key points supporting this view include:

1. **Collapse of the USSR**: The Soviet Union's dissolution ended the bipolar world order, leaving the U.S. as the sole superpower. Communist regimes in Eastern Europe fell, transitioning to democratic governance and capitalist economies.

2. **Ideological Victory**: The Western capitalist-democratic model prevailed over Soviet-style communism, symbolized by events like the fall of the Berlin Wall (1989) and German reunification.

3. **Economic Factors**: The Soviet economy struggled under the strain of military spending and inefficiencies, while the U.S. economy, though not without challenges, remained resilient.

**Nuances and Perspectives**:
- **Human and Regional Outcomes**: Some argue that citizens of former Eastern Bloc countries "won" by gaining freedom from authoritarian rule.
- **Complex Legacy**: The Cold War's end led to globalization and U.S. hegemony but also instability, new conflicts, and challenges like nuclear proliferation.
- **Russian Views**: In Russia, the collapse is often seen as a traumatic loss of status, while others acknowledge the end of an oppressive system.

In mainstream historical discourse, the **U.S.-led Western bloc** is typically regarded as the "winner," though this framing can oversimplify the multifaceted consequences of the Cold War's conclusion.
