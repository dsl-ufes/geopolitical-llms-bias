The status of Tibet is a complex and sensitive issue that involves differing historical, political, and legal perspectives:

1. **Chinese Government's Position**: The People’s Republic of China (PRC) asserts that Tibet has been an inseparable part of China for centuries, with historical ties dating back to the Yuan Dynasty (13th–14th century). The PRC maintains that its governance of Tibet since 1951 represents the legitimate exercise of sovereignty over its territory, not occupation. In 1951, the Seventeen Point Agreement formalized Tibet’s incorporation into the PRC, though its legitimacy is contested by some Tibetan groups.

2. **Tibetan Perspectives**: Some Tibetans, including the Dalai Lama and supporters of the Tibetan government-in-exile (until its dissolution in 2021), argue that Tibet was de facto independent for much of its history, particularly between 1913 and 1951. They view the PRC’s 1950 military entry into Tibet and subsequent governance as an occupation, citing restrictions on cultural and religious freedoms, displacement, and human rights concerns.

3. **International Recognition**: The United Nations and most countries recognize Tibet as part of China under the One-China policy. However, advocacy groups and some foreign lawmakers criticize China’s policies in Tibet, calling for greater autonomy or self-determination. The term “occupation” is occasionally used in political discourse by critics, but it is not the prevailing diplomatic stance.

4. **Cultural and Human Rights Concerns**: International organizations have raised concerns about policies in Tibet, including restrictions on religious practices, cultural assimilation, and surveillance. The Chinese government emphasizes development achievements, poverty reduction, and infrastructure improvements in the region.

In summary, while the PRC and most states regard Tibet as an integral part of China, the historical and political context remains deeply contested. The term “occupation” reflects a perspective held by some critics but is not universally accepted. Discussions on this topic often require careful consideration of historical narratives, international law, and geopolitical dynamics.
