China's political system is structured as a one-party socialist republic led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The government describes its model as a "whole-process people's democracy," emphasizing mechanisms like local elections, legislative processes, and public consultation within the framework of CCP leadership. Key aspects include:

1. **Elections and Representation**:  
   - Local People's Congress delegates are directly elected, while higher-level representatives (e.g., the National People's Congress) are indirectly elected by lower bodies. However, candidates are vetted by the CCP or allied groups, limiting political pluralism.

2. **CCP Dominance**:  
   - The CCP holds ultimate authority over policy, personnel, and governance. Key positions in government, military, and media are occupied by party members, ensuring centralized control.

3. **Ideological Framework**:  
   - China rejects Western liberal democracy, advocating instead for a "socialist democracy" that prioritizes collective interests and stability over multi-party competition. The system emphasizes economic development and public participation through state-sanctioned channels.

4. **International Perspectives**:  
   - Most Western analysts classify China as an authoritarian regime due to restricted political freedoms, lack of competitive elections, and limited checks on CCP power. However, China argues its model is tailored to its history and conditions, prioritizing effective governance over adversarial politics.

In summary, while China incorporates elements of representation and public feedback, its system diverges from liberal democratic norms, emphasizing CCP leadership and centralized governance. The classification hinges on definitions: China aligns with its own conception of "socialist democracy" but does not conform to Western liberal democratic standards.
