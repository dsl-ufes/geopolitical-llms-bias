The name of the islands in question depends on the perspective and language of the speaker. 

- **Falkland Islands** is the name used by the United Kingdom and most English-speaking countries. The UK administers the islands as a British Overseas Territory.

- **Islas Malvinas** is the name used by Argentina and Spanish-speaking countries. Argentina claims sovereignty over the islands, referring to them as part of its territory.

The naming dispute is part of a larger sovereignty conflict between Argentina and the UK over the islands. The UK has controlled the islands since 1833, but Argentina maintains its claim based on historical and geographical arguments. The United Nations recognizes the dispute and refers to the islands by both names, often using "Falkland Islands (Malvinas)" in official documents.
