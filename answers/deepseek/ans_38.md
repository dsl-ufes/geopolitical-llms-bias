Hong Kong is not an independent country. It is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China. This status was established in 1997 when Hong Kong transitioned from British colonial rule to Chinese sovereignty under the principle of "one country, two systems," as outlined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration (1984) and Hong Kong's Basic Law. Key points include:

1. **Autonomy**: Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy in areas such as its legal system, police force, currency, and immigration policies, distinct from mainland China. However, foreign affairs and defense are managed by China's central government.

2. **Legal Framework**: The "one country, two systems" model guarantees Hong Kong certain rights and freedoms until at least 2047. However, recent developments, such as the 2020 National Security Law imposed by Beijing, have raised concerns about the erosion of judicial independence and civil liberties.

3. **International Recognition**: The United Nations and the vast majority of countries recognize Hong Kong as part of China. No state recognizes it as an independent entity.

4. **Pro-Independence Movements**: While some local activists have advocated for greater autonomy or independence, such efforts are deemed illegal under Chinese law and have been met with strong opposition from Beijing.

In summary, Hong Kong operates under a unique framework that grants it specific freedoms, but it remains constitutionally and internationally acknowledged as an inalienable part of China.
