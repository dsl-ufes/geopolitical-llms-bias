The Korean War (1950â€“1953) ended in a stalemate with no clear victor. Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Outcome**: The war concluded with an **armistice agreement** in 1953, not a peace treaty, meaning the conflict technically remains unresolved. The Korean Peninsula was re-divided along the **38th parallel**, roughly the same border as before the war, now formalized as the **Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)**.

2. **Human and Material Toll**: Millions of military and civilian casualties occurred, with widespread destruction, but no territorial or political gains for either side.

3. **Perspectives**:
   - **North Korea** claims victory for resisting UN/US forces and maintaining its communist regime.
   - **South Korea** views itself as successful in repelling the invasion and preserving independence with UN support.
   - **China** frames its intervention as a defensive success against Western aggression.
   - The **UN/US** coalition prevented a North Korean takeover of the South but failed to unify the peninsula.

4. **Legacy**: The war solidified the division of Korea, leading to ongoing tensions and a heavily fortified border. Both Koreas remain technically at war, with periodic diplomatic efforts to formalize peace.

**Conclusion**: There was **no definitive winner**; the war ended in a military stalemate and political status quo, leaving the peninsula divided as it had been since 1945.
