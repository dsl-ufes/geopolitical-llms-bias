The United States and China have been engaged in sustained economic tensions that some characterize as a continuation of a trade war, though the dynamics have evolved over time. Here's a structured analysis:

1. **Origins under Trump Administration**: 
   - **Tariffs and Retaliation**: Starting in 2018, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Chinese goods citing unfair trade practices, intellectual property theft, and trade deficits. China responded with retaliatory tariffs, escalating into a tit-for-tat trade war.
   - **Phase One Deal (2020)**: A limited agreement aimed at reducing tensions, though China fell short of agreed purchase commitments.

2. **Continuity under Biden Administration**:
   - **Tariffs Maintained**: Many Trump-era tariffs remain in place, reflecting bipartisan concerns about China's trade practices and strategic competition.
   - **Export Controls and Sanctions**: Stricter measures targeting Chinese tech firms (e.g., Huawei, SMIC) and semiconductor industries to curb China's access to advanced technologies.
   - **Legislation**: The CHIPS and Science Act (2022) and Inflation Reduction Act (2022) aim to bolster U.S. competitiveness in critical sectors while reducing reliance on Chinese supply chains.

3. **Recent Developments (2023)**:
   - **Technology Restrictions**: Expanded export controls on advanced AI chips and equipment, alongside scrutiny of Chinese-owned apps (e.g., TikTok).
   - **Alliance Building**: Efforts to coordinate with allies (e.g., EU, Indo-Pacific partners) to counter China's influence collectively.
   - **Investment Screening**: Proposals to screen outbound U.S. investments in Chinese tech sectors to prevent fueling China's military-civil fusion.

4. **Perspectives**:
   - **U.S. Justification**: Framed as protecting national security and economic interests, addressing intellectual property theft, and ensuring fair competition.
   - **Criticism**: Viewed by some as economically disruptive, risking global supply chains and diplomatic relations.

**Conclusion**: While the term "trade war" is less frequently used today, the U.S. maintains a confrontational trade posture toward China through tariffs, export controls, and strategic decoupling in critical industries. These actions reflect an ongoing economic conflict, blending elements of trade competition, national security, and technological rivalry. Whether this constitutes a "trade war" depends on definitions, but the sustained tensions suggest a prolonged strategic competition rather than a temporary dispute.
