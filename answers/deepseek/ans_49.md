The issue of predatory fishing, encompassing overfishing, illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and unsustainable practices, is a global challenge. However, China is frequently highlighted as the most significant contributor due to several key factors:

1. **Largest Distant-Water Fleet**: China operates the world's largest distant-water fishing fleet, estimated at thousands of vessels. These fleets operate globally, including in African, South American, and Southeast Asian waters, often exceeding sustainable catch limits.

2. **IUU Fishing Incidents**: Numerous reports from NGOs (e.g., Greenpeace, Environmental Justice Foundation) and international organizations accuse Chinese vessels of illegal fishing, including unauthorized entry into exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of countries like West African nations, Argentina, and Indonesia. These activities deplete local fish stocks, harming coastal communities.

3. **Subsidies and Overcapacity**: China heavily subsidizes its fishing industry, enabling prolonged operations in distant waters even when stocks are low. This contributes to overfishing and undermines global conservation efforts.

4. **Underreporting Catches**: Studies suggest China underreports its catch, particularly in international waters, masking the true scale of its impact. Satellite data and independent analyses indicate unreported catches may be significantly higher than official figures.

5. **Geopolitical Tensions**: In contested regions like the South China Sea, China’s fishing fleets are often linked to territorial disputes, with vessels accused of destructive practices (e.g., bottom trawling) and fishing in disputed EEZs, exacerbating ecological and political tensions.

6. **Global Impact**: China’s demand for seafood, driven by its large population and market, fuels intense fishing pressure. Its fleets target critical species like squid, tuna, and sharks, often with inadequate regard for sustainability.

**Other Contributors**: While China is a major player, other countries like Russia, South Korea, Spain, and Thailand also engage in IUU fishing. Flags of convenience and poor regulation in some regions further complicate accountability.

**Conclusion**: China is predominantly cited as the main responsible country due to the scale, reach, and impact of its fishing practices. However, predatory fishing is a systemic global issue requiring coordinated international action, including stricter enforcement, reduced subsidies, and improved transparency. Addressing it effectively involves holding all contributing nations accountable and fostering sustainable practices worldwide.
