The Nagorno-Karabakh region is a contested territory with a complex history. Here's a concise summary of its status:

1. **Historical Context**:  
   - During the Soviet era, Nagorno-Karabakh was an autonomous oblast within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), despite its majority ethnic Armenian population.  
   - After the USSR collapsed in 1991, tensions escalated into a war (1991–1994) between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Ethnic Armenians, backed by Armenia, gained control of the region and surrounding territories, establishing the self-declared **Republic of Artsakh**. This entity was not internationally recognized.

2. **International Recognition**:  
   - The United Nations and nearly all countries recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as part of **Azerbaijan** under international law, though Armenia historically supported its independence.

3. **2020 War and Ceasefire**:  
   - In late 2020, Azerbaijan, aided by Turkey, regained significant territory during a 44-day war. A Russia-brokered ceasefire left parts of Nagorno-Karabakh under Armenian control but mandated the return of surrounding regions to Azerbaijan.

4. **2023 Azerbaijani Offensive**:  
   - In September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a military operation, leading to the dissolution of the Republic of Artsakh. Nearly all ethnic Armenians fled the region, and Azerbaijan assumed full control.  

5. **Current Status**:  
   - As of 2023, Azerbaijan exercises **de facto** and **de jure** control over Nagorno-Karabakh. The conflict’s resolution remains fragile, with ongoing humanitarian concerns and geopolitical tensions, particularly involving Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, and Turkey.

In summary, while Azerbaijan now governs the region, the dispute’s roots in ethnic identity, historical grievances, and regional politics persist.
