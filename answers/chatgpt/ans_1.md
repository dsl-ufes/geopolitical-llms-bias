The name depends on the perspective and context:  

- **"Islas Malvinas"** is the name used in **Argentina** and many Spanish-speaking countries. Argentina claims sovereignty over the islands.  
- **"Falkland Islands"** is the name used in **the United Kingdom** and by the local population. The islands are a British Overseas Territory.  

The sovereignty of the islands has been a long-standing dispute between Argentina and the UK, culminating in the **Falklands War** in 1982. The islands remain under British control, and in a 2013 referendum, **99.8% of the islanders voted to remain British**. However, Argentina continues to assert its claim over them.
