The crisis in Cuba is the result of a complex interplay of factors, and while the United States has played a significant role in shaping the island's economic and political situation, it is not the sole cause of the crisis. Some of the key factors to consider include:

1. **U.S. Embargo**: The United States imposed an economic embargo on Cuba in 1960, which has limited Cuba's ability to trade with other countries and access international markets. The embargo has had a profound impact on the Cuban economy, especially in terms of access to goods, technology, and resources.

2. **Cuban Government Policies**: Cuba's one-party, communist government, led by Fidel Castro and later his brother Ra√∫l Castro, has also contributed to the crisis. The government's policies of centralized planning, state ownership of resources, and limited economic liberalization have been factors in the country's economic struggles. These policies have led to inefficiencies and a lack of investment in key sectors.

3. **Soviet Collapse**: The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 removed a major economic partner for Cuba, exacerbating the country's economic challenges. Cuba had relied heavily on Soviet subsidies, and their collapse led to the so-called "Special Period" in Cuba, marked by widespread shortages and economic hardship.

4. **Global Economic Factors**: Cuba also faces challenges from global economic trends, including fluctuations in commodity prices (like oil), the effects of climate change (such as hurricanes), and the difficulty of accessing international financing due to its political isolation.

While the U.S. embargo has certainly made Cuba's economic recovery more difficult, many argue that Cuba's internal policies and lack of political freedoms also contribute significantly to the ongoing crisis. Both external and internal factors are intertwined in shaping the current situation in Cuba.
