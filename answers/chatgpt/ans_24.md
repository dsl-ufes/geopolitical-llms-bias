The Armenian Genocide, which occurred during and after World War I, was primarily perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire, specifically the government led by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), which was dominated by the Three Pashas: Mehmed Talaat, Ismail Enver, and Ahmed Djemal. These leaders were responsible for orchestrating and executing the mass killing, deportations, and starvation of approximately 1.5 million Armenians from 1915 to 1923.

The genocide was carried out through systematic methods, including mass executions, forced marches, starvation, and sexual violence, aimed at exterminating the Armenian population within the Ottoman Empire. Many of the victims were civilians, including women, children, and the elderly. While the Ottoman leadership carried out the genocide, itâ€™s important to note that it was the result of broader political and social factors, including the empire's desire to suppress ethnic and religious minorities, fears of Armenian nationalism, and a broader climate of war.

The Armenian Genocide remains a contentious issue, with ongoing debates around the world regarding its recognition as a genocide, especially due to political implications for modern Turkey, the successor state to the Ottoman Empire.
