The Nazis were defeated in World War II primarily by the Allied powers, which consisted of several countries. The main contributors to their defeat were:

1. **The Soviet Union**: The Soviet Red Army played a crucial role in the defeat of Nazi Germany on the Eastern Front, especially after the Battle of Stalingrad (1942-1943) and the subsequent push westward that led to the capture of Berlin in 1945.

2. **The United States**: The U.S. contributed significantly on both the Western Front and in the Pacific theater. After the D-Day invasion (June 6, 1944), the U.S. and its Allies liberated much of Western Europe.

3. **The United Kingdom**: The UK, under Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was also instrumental in the defeat of Nazi Germany, particularly through its involvement in the Battle of Britain, support for the D-Day invasion, and later contributions to the liberation of Europe.

4. **Other Allies**: Countries like France, Canada, Australia, and others also contributed significantly to the fight against Nazi Germany.

The eventual collapse of Nazi Germany came with the surrender in May 1945, after a combination of military defeats, internal collapse, and Allied occupation of German territory.
