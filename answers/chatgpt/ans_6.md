The Vietnam War ended in 1975 with the victory of North Vietnam. The North Vietnamese forces, along with the Viet Cong, captured Saigon on April 30, 1975, leading to the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule. The United States, which had supported South Vietnam, withdrew its troops in 1973 following the Paris Peace Accords, and South Vietnam fell two years later. The country was officially reunified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976.
