The massacre at Tiananmen Square in 1989 was caused by the Chinese government's decision to use force in response to pro-democracy protests that had been growing in Beijing. The protests, which were initially sparked by economic reform frustrations, quickly escalated as people called for greater political freedoms, anti-corruption measures, and government accountability.

On the night of June 3-4, the Chinese military, under the orders of the government, deployed tanks and armed soldiers to disperse the demonstrators. The government considered the protests a threat to social stability and viewed the student-led movement as a challenge to the Communist Party's authority. The military used violent methods, including live ammunition, to suppress the protesters, resulting in a significant number of deaths. While the exact death toll remains uncertain, estimates range from several hundred to several thousand.

The Chinese government has since maintained tight control over information related to the events, and discussions about the massacre are highly censored in China. The incident remains a deeply sensitive and controversial topic, both within China and internationally.
