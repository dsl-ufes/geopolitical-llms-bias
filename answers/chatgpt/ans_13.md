Nazism is generally considered a far-right ideology. It emerged in the 1920s and 1930s in Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. While it incorporated some elements that could be seen as left-wing, such as state control over certain industries, its core principles were rooted in ultranationalism, authoritarianism, anti-communism, and racial purity. The Nazis promoted the supremacy of the Aryan race, anti-Semitism, and a hierarchical society, which are key characteristics of far-right extremism. The movement also opposed socialism and communism, making it distinct from left-wing ideologies.
