No, Hong Kong is not independent. It is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China. While Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy in most areas under the "one country, two systems" framework, it remains under Chinese sovereignty. This arrangement was established after Hong Kong was handed back to China from British rule in 1997. However, in recent years, there have been concerns about Beijing's increasing influence over Hong Kong's governance and its autonomy.
