The war in Syria is a complex conflict with multiple actors and causes. While it began as a civil uprising in 2011 against President **Bashar al-Assad** and his government, it quickly escalated into a multi-sided war involving various rebel groups, jihadist factions, Kurdish militias, and foreign powers.

### Key Responsible Parties:
1. **Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian Government** – Assad's regime responded to peaceful protests with violent repression, leading to the militarization of the conflict. The government has been accused of war crimes, including chemical attacks, targeting civilians, and widespread human rights abuses.

2. **Opposition and Rebel Groups** – Various rebel factions, including the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and later Islamist groups like al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda affiliate) and ISIS, played a role in escalating the violence. Some factions engaged in their own human rights violations.

3. **ISIS (Islamic State)** – The terrorist group exploited the chaos to establish its self-proclaimed caliphate, committing extreme atrocities and attracting foreign intervention.

4. **Foreign Powers**:
   - **Russia** – Provided military and political support to Assad, including airstrikes and diplomatic backing.
   - **Iran** and **Hezbollah** – Sent fighters and military aid to Assad’s government.
   - **Turkey** – Supported opposition forces and later intervened against Kurdish militias.
   - **United States** – Initially backed certain rebel groups and later focused on fighting ISIS.
   - **Gulf States (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE)** – Funded and armed various rebel groups.

There is no single "main" responsible party, as the conflict was fueled by a mix of authoritarian repression, sectarian tensions, foreign interventions, and extremist elements.
