The United States is often described as a democracy, but more specifically, it is a *representative democracy* or a *republic*. In a representative democracy, citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf, rather than making decisions directly through referenda or other forms of direct democracy. The U.S. also has a system of checks and balances, with separate branches of government (executive, legislative, and judicial) designed to prevent any one branch from gaining too much power. So, while the U.S. is a democracy in the sense that it allows for the participation of its citizens through voting, it operates through a representative system rather than direct democracy.
