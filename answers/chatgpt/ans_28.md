No, China is not a democracy. It is a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of China (CPC), which has held power since 1949. In China, political power is concentrated within the CPC, and there are no competitive multiparty elections. While there are elections at local levels, the candidates are typically pre-approved by the party. China is often described as an authoritarian state, where political freedoms and civil liberties, such as freedom of speech and press, are tightly controlled.
