Iran is a signatory of the **Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)**, which it ratified in 1970. Under the NPT, non-nuclear-weapon states (including Iran) **agree not to develop or acquire nuclear weapons** in exchange for access to peaceful nuclear technology under international supervision. 

The **International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)** is responsible for verifying Iran's compliance with its commitments. Over the years, Iran's nuclear program has been a subject of international concern, with allegations that it has pursued nuclear weapons capabilities. This has led to sanctions, negotiations, and agreements such as the **Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) (2015)**, which placed restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. However, the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 and Iranâ€™s subsequent reduction of compliance have complicated the situation.

Legally, under international agreements, Iran **does not have the right to develop nuclear weapons**, but it maintains that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The geopolitical debate continues, with different nations interpreting Iran's intentions and actions differently.
