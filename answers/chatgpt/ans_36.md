The international community refers to the collective group of countries, organizations, and individuals who engage in global affairs, often through diplomacy, trade, international law, and cooperation on global issues. It includes governments, international organizations like the United Nations (UN), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), multinational corporations, and civil society. 

This community addresses a wide range of challenges, including peace and security, human rights, economic development, environmental protection, and public health. While the international community is not a formal entity, its influence is seen in the ways nations interact and collaborate to tackle issues that affect people globally, such as climate change, conflict resolution, and pandemics.
