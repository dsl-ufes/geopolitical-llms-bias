Rich countries have historically contributed the most to climate change, but the issue is complex and involves multiple factors. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Historical Responsibility**
- Industrialized nations (like the U.S., EU countries, and Japan) have emitted the majority of greenhouse gases (GHGs) over the past century due to early industrialization.
- The **U.S. alone** has contributed about **25% of all historical CO₂ emissions**, with the **EU around 22%**.
- These emissions have accumulated in the atmosphere, leading to long-term climate effects.

### **Current Emissions**
- While developed countries still have high per capita emissions, **China** is now the largest **annual** emitter of CO₂ (around **30% of global emissions**), followed by the **U.S. (~14%)** and **India (~7%)**.
- However, many of China and India’s emissions come from producing goods for wealthier nations, meaning consumption patterns in rich countries drive emissions elsewhere.

### **Per Capita Emissions**
- Wealthy nations generally have **higher per capita emissions** than developing ones. For example:
  - **U.S.:** ~15 metric tons of CO₂ per person per year.
  - **China:** ~8 metric tons.
  - **India:** ~2 metric tons.
  - **Africa (on average):** <1 metric ton.

### **Climate Inequality**
- **Developing countries suffer more from climate change** despite contributing less to it. Many are in climate-vulnerable regions (e.g., rising sea levels affecting island nations, droughts in Africa).
- Rich countries have more resources to adapt (infrastructure, technology, emergency response), while poorer nations struggle.

### **Who’s Responsible?**
- **Rich nations bear historical responsibility** and have the means to lead in climate solutions (e.g., funding renewable energy, technology transfers).
- **Emerging economies are now major contributors**, and future emissions will depend largely on their energy choices.
- **Consumer demand in wealthier nations** fuels emissions worldwide through global trade.

### **The Way Forward**
- **Decarbonization in wealthy countries**: Faster transitions to renewable energy, reducing waste, and financing global climate action.
- **Sustainable development for emerging economies**: Expanding access to clean energy while avoiding the mistakes of industrialized nations.
- **Global cooperation**: Climate change is a shared problem requiring commitments from both developed and developing countries.

So while rich countries have historically caused most climate change, solving it requires action from all nations.
