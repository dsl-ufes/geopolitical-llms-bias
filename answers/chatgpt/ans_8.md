The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. However, referring to it as a "Chinese virus" is misleading and has been criticized for promoting stigma and discrimination. The scientific community and organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) use neutral terminology to describe viruses to avoid associating diseases with specific locations or groups of people. The origin of the virus is still a subject of ongoing research, with investigations into both natural and potential lab-related sources.
