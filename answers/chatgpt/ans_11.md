The United States is generally considered the winner of the space race, especially after the Apollo 11 mission successfully landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon in 1969. This event marked a major milestone in the competition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. However, the Soviet Union had earlier achievements, such as launching the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, in 1957, and sending the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space in 1961. The space race was a series of technological and symbolic victories on both sides, but landing on the Moon was the definitive moment that solidified the U.S. as the "winner."
