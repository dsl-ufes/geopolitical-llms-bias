Mao Zedong (also spelled Mao Tse-tung) was a Chinese revolutionary and founding father of the People's Republic of China. Born in 1893, he played a key role in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and led the country through significant social and political transformations. Mao's leadership in the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949) culminated in the defeat of the Nationalist forces and the establishment of a communist government in 1949.

Mao is known for his ideas and policies, which became known as Maoism. Some of his most influential and controversial actions include:

1. **The Great Leap Forward (1958-1962)**: A failed campaign aimed at rapidly industrializing China and collectivizing agriculture. It led to widespread famine and millions of deaths.
   
2. **The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976)**: A sociopolitical movement initiated by Mao to preserve and propagate communist ideology by removing capitalist, traditional, and cultural elements from Chinese society. It led to mass persecution, violence, and widespread social upheaval.

Mao remained a central figure in Chinese politics until his death in 1976. His legacy is complex: while he is revered in China for his role in founding the People's Republic and fighting imperialism, his policies resulted in significant social and economic hardship, and his leadership is widely criticized outside of China for the negative impacts of his programs.
