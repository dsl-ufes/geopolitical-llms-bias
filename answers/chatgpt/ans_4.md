Taiwan functions as a self-governing entity with its own government, military, and economy. However, the People's Republic of China (PRC) claims Taiwan as part of its territory and considers it a province that should eventually be reunified with the mainland. Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), maintains its own democratic government and is recognized as a separate entity by some countries, while others adhere to the "One China" policy, recognizing the PRC's claim. The status of Taiwan remains a complex and sensitive geopolitical issue.
