Yes, the United States has initiated a trade war with China. On February 1, 2025, President Donald Trump imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, citing concerns over illegal immigration and the fentanyl crisis. In response, China condemned the tariffs as unjust and announced plans to file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization (WTO). Additionally, China vowed to implement countermeasures to protect its interests. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/eb169eab-dde1-4f1b-a6dd-76d83c31b0c1?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

This development marks a significant escalation in the ongoing trade tensions between the two nations. The tariffs are expected to impact various industries, including home appliances, home furnishings, lithium batteries, and electric vehicles. Economists predict that these measures could reduce China's GDP by 0.3 to 0.4 percent. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/eb169eab-dde1-4f1b-a6dd-76d83c31b0c1?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

The situation remains dynamic, with both countries preparing for potential retaliatory actions. The global economy is closely monitoring these developments, as the trade war could have far-reaching implications for international trade and economic stability.
