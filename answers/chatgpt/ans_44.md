The **Great Firewall of China** is a combination of laws, technologies, and policies implemented by the Chinese government to regulate and control internet access within the country. Officially part of the **Golden Shield Project**, it is designed to **censor content, block access to foreign websites, and monitor online activities** to align with government policies and maintain control over the flow of information.

### **How It Works**
The Great Firewall employs various techniques, including:
- **IP blocking** – Prevents access to specific foreign websites.
- **DNS filtering** – Manipulates domain name resolution to block or redirect requests.
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** – Monitors and filters internet traffic based on keywords and data patterns.
- **Keyword filtering** – Blocks content containing politically sensitive terms.
- **Connection resets** – Interrupts data transfers to restricted sites.

### **What’s Blocked?**
Many popular international websites and services are inaccessible in China, including:
- **Google services** (Search, Gmail, YouTube, etc.)
- **Social media** (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit)
- **News websites** (BBC, The New York Times, Wikipedia in some cases)
- **Messaging apps** (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal)

### **Ways People Bypass It**
Some users rely on **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** and **proxy servers** to bypass restrictions, though the government actively works to detect and block them.

The Great Firewall plays a key role in China's broader strategy of **cyber sovereignty**, ensuring that digital information aligns with state policies and limiting external influence on public opinion.
