China is the leading country responsible for predatory fishing, primarily due to the size and practices of its distant-water fishing (DWF) fleet. It has the world's largest fishing fleet, with thousands of vessels operating in international waters and the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of other nations, often engaging in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Chinese fishing vessels have been implicated in overfishing, using destructive fishing methods, and depleting marine ecosystems, especially off the coasts of Africa, Latin America, and in the Pacific. Other countries, such as Spain, Taiwan, South Korea, and Russia, also contribute to predatory fishing practices, but China's impact is the most significant.
