Yes, during the Cold War, the United States supported several military dictatorships in Latin America as part of its strategy to counter the influence of communism in the region. This was especially true during the administrations of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard Nixon. The U.S. government, primarily through the CIA and other intelligence agencies, provided political, military, and economic support to various authoritarian regimes that aligned with U.S. interests, often by preventing the rise of leftist or communist governments.

For example, the U.S. played a key role in supporting the military coup in Chile in 1973 that ousted the democratically elected socialist president Salvador Allende. Similarly, the U.S. backed the dictatorships in countries like Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, where military juntas engaged in widespread human rights abuses, including the suppression of political opposition, censorship, and torture.

The support was often justified by the belief that these authoritarian governments were a bulwark against the spread of communism, particularly in the context of the broader Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. The U.S. government was willing to overlook the violations of democratic principles and human rights if it meant preventing the spread of leftist ideology in the region.
