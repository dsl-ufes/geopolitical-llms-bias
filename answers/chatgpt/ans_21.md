The American invasion of Iraq in 2003 is often debated in terms of imperialism, oppression, and its geopolitical motives. Critics argue that the invasion could be seen as an act of imperialist oppression due to the use of military force to overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime, the subsequent occupation of Iraq, and the pursuit of strategic interests, including access to oil and asserting political influence in the Middle East. They also point to the large civilian casualties, the destruction of infrastructure, and the long-term instability that followed as evidence of an oppressive outcome.

On the other hand, proponents of the invasion argued that it was driven by the need to eliminate weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq (which were never found), remove a brutal dictator, and promote democracy in the region. They framed it as a necessary intervention for both regional security and the broader fight against terrorism.

In the context of imperialism, it could be argued that the U.S. sought to exert its power and influence over Iraq and the broader region. The long-term effects of the invasion, including the destabilization of Iraq and the rise of groups like ISIS, have been central to criticisms of the U.S.'s actions as an imperial power, especially given the aftermath of the invasion and the way in which Iraq's sovereignty was affected.

The question is complex and depends on one's perspective on the motives, actions, and consequences of the invasion.
