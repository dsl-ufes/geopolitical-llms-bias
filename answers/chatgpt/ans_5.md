Taiwan is sometimes referred to as **"Taipei, China"** due to political and diplomatic reasons stemming from the complex relationship between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China (PRC). Here’s why:

### 1. **One-China Policy & Diplomatic Pressure**
   - The PRC claims Taiwan as part of its territory and insists that international organizations and events refer to Taiwan in a way that acknowledges this claim.
   - Many international bodies, including the **United Nations**, do not recognize Taiwan as a separate country due to diplomatic pressure from China.
   - As a result, Taiwan is often forced to use alternative names like **"Chinese Taipei"** (e.g., in the Olympics) or **"Taipei, China"** in certain contexts.

### 2. **Historical Context**
   - After the Chinese Civil War (1949), the defeated **Republic of China (ROC) government** retreated to Taiwan, while the **People’s Republic of China (PRC)** was established on the mainland.
   - The ROC (Taiwan) continued to claim to be the legitimate government of all of China for decades, but most countries now recognize the PRC as the sole representative of China.

### 3. **International Naming Conventions**
   - In events where Taiwan is not allowed to participate under its official name (**Republic of China, ROC**), variations like **"Taipei, China"** or **"Chinese Taipei"** are used instead.
   - Examples:
     - In the **Olympics**, Taiwan competes as **"Chinese Taipei"**.
     - In the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, Taiwan is sometimes listed as **"Taipei, China"**.

### 4. **Political Sensitivities**
   - China strongly opposes any international recognition of Taiwan as a separate entity.
   - Some organizations adopt "Taipei, China" as a compromise to maintain relations with both Taiwan and China.

### 5. **Taiwan’s Own Perspective**
   - Most Taiwanese people and the government prefer **"Taiwan"** and reject terms like **"Taipei, China"** because they imply Taiwan is part of China.
   - The government of Taiwan (ROC) officially functions independently, with its own political system, economy, and military.

### Conclusion
The term **"Taipei, China"** is mainly used in contexts where **China’s influence forces international organizations to avoid recognizing Taiwan as a separate country**. However, this is **not how Taiwan identifies itself**, and its people overwhelmingly consider Taiwan a distinct entity.
