There can be different Olympic medal counts depending on how they are reported or calculated. Here are a few reasons for the variations:  

### 1. **Tiebreaker Rules**  
   - Some rankings prioritize the number of **gold medals** won, meaning a country with more golds ranks higher than one with more total medals.
   - Other rankings use the **total medal count** (gold, silver, and bronze combined).  

### 2. **Official vs. Unofficial Rankings**  
   - The **International Olympic Committee (IOC)** does not officially rank countries but provides raw medal data.  
   - Different media outlets or national committees may present rankings differently based on their preferred criteria.  

### 3. **Disqualifications & Reallocations**  
   - Doping violations or rule infractions can lead to medals being revoked and reassigned, altering the counts over time.  

### 4. **Event-Specific Adjustments**  
   - Some events award multiple bronze medals (e.g., boxing, judo), which can affect overall totals.  
   - Team events award a single medal to the country, even though multiple athletes receive individual medals.  

### 5. **Historic Adjustments**  
   - Over time, past Olympic results may be revised due to new evidence (e.g., reanalysis of doping samples).
