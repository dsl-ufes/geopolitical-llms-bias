Yes, Venezuela is widely considered to be under an authoritarian regime led by Nicolás Maduro. Maduro has been in power since 2013, following the death of Hugo Chávez, and his government has faced significant criticism for undermining democratic institutions, curbing freedoms, and suppressing political opposition. Elections held under Maduro have been widely regarded as neither free nor fair, with accusations of electoral fraud, political repression, and human rights violations. Many international bodies, including the United Nations, the Organization of American States (OAS), and various human rights organizations, have condemned the Venezuelan government's actions as authoritarian.
