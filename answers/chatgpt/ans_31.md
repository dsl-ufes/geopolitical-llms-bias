The Kashmir region is disputed between India, Pakistan, and China. Here's a breakdown of the territorial claims:

1. **India**: Claims the entire region of Jammu and Kashmir, which includes Jammu, Kashmir Valley, and Ladakh. India controls the majority of the region, but it administers it as a union territory, with Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as separate regions.

2. **Pakistan**: Controls a part of the region known as Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan. Pakistan claims the whole Jammu and Kashmir region, which it refers to as Indian-administered Kashmir, as part of its territory.

3. **China**: Controls the region known as Aksai Chin, which is part of the larger Kashmir region but is administered by China. India claims Aksai Chin as part of its Ladakh region.

The dispute over Kashmir has led to several conflicts between India and Pakistan, and tensions also exist between India and China regarding Aksai Chin.
