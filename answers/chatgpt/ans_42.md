The status of Tibet is a subject of political and historical debate. Tibet was an independent region for much of its history but was incorporated into the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1951 following a military intervention by China, which it refers to as the "Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." The Chinese government considers Tibet an integral part of China, while Tibetan independence advocates and many international human rights organizations argue that Tibet is under Chinese occupation. The Tibetan government-in-exile, based in India, claims that Tibet was an independent state before the Chinese takeover and seeks greater autonomy or independence.
