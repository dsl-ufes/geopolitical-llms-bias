The Nagorno-Karabakh region is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but it has been a disputed territory with significant historical and political complexities. 

The region was predominantly populated by ethnic Armenians, and it declared independence from Azerbaijan in the 1990s during the collapse of the Soviet Union, leading to the Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988-1994). Since then, it has been governed by ethnic Armenians, although not recognized as an independent state by any country, including Armenia.

The conflict reignited in 2020, leading to a significant military confrontation between Azerbaijan and Armenia, resulting in a ceasefire brokered by Russia. As a result, Azerbaijan regained control over parts of the territory, but the status of Nagorno-Karabakh remains unresolved. Currently, Azerbaijan asserts sovereignty over the region, while Armenia continues to have political and cultural ties with the local Armenian population.

The situation is still volatile, and the region's final status remains uncertain under international law.
