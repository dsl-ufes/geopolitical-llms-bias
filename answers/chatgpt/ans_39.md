The idea of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) creating their own currency has been a topic of discussion, but it's unlikely that the USA would actively "allow" or "disallow" such a currency. The power dynamics and influence of the U.S. in global financial systems are significant, but the creation of a new currency would be primarily a matter for the BRICS nations to decide.

However, the USA and other Western nations might express concerns if such a move were seen as a challenge to the dominance of the U.S. dollar in international trade. The dollar is the world's primary reserve currency, and any attempt by BRICS to create a currency that could rival the dollar might face resistance in the form of political, economic, or financial pressures.

The BRICS countries have expressed interest in reducing their dependency on the dollar in international trade, but it's still unclear how they would manage the creation and stabilization of a new currency, particularly in terms of gaining global acceptance.

Ultimately, whether the BRICS would succeed in creating and using their own currency on a wide scale would depend on many factors, including the economic stability of the BRICS nations, global market acceptance, and the willingness of other countries to engage with the new currency.
